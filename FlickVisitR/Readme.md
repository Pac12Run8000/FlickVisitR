How to use FlickVisitR
======
1. When you start up the application, you will see a Map. If you go all the way to the bottom, you can see the tabs of a tabbar controller. You can select from either a MapView or a TableView.

5. If you click on the plus button "+", you will navigate to a controller where you can enter an address and once you click the done button, you will be returned to the map and a pin will be dropped on the location that correlates to the address that you entered.
